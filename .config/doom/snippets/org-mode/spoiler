# Ok, there's an issue with ?evil-org? and yasnippet tabbing through fields
# that particularly effects this snippet
# Problems
# 1. the begin…end block is collapsed
# 2. tabbing after the $1 field works (with my hack in config.org)
#    but doesn't expand the begin…end block
#    so you end up at the folded line.
# Solution
# type into $1, escape to switch to normal moder, tab to unfold, 'i'
# to return to insert mode, tab to move the cursor into the begin…end
# Yes, this is fucking stupid
