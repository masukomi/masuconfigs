# The name of the command or function you're documenting
# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.

# a short (one line) description of what it does

description="""
When you need to strip some ANSI escape codes from some text.

Admittely, this is a niche tool, but I wrote [oho](https://github.com/masukomi/oho),
so i deal with this stuff way more than normal people.

Pipe text into it. It'll "scour" the escape codes from the text
and send the result to Standard Out

Prerequisets:
* [gnu-sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) (brew install gnu-sed)
  because BSD's sed is... "inferior"

# If the tool has some sort of usage / help documentation you can
# invoke, enter it in the usage_command. Otherwise, comment that out,
# and document it in the fallback_usage. In TOML you can create a
# multiline string by surrounding it with triple double quotes.
