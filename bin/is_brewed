# A simple script to tell you if something is installed
# with homebrew or not. If not it'll also check if it
# was maybe installed with a specific version.
# eg mongodb-community might not be installed while
# mongodb-community@4.2 may be.
# exits with 0 or 1 for use in automations
# but also has text output for humans.
#
# Usage: is_brewed <name of package to check for>
