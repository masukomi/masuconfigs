# The name of the command or function you're documenting
# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.
name="urls2links"
# a short (one line) description of what it does
short_description="finds https* urls in the specifed docs and makes a href tags around them"

# an optional detailed description of what it does.
# definitely include this if you're going to generate a web site.
# Note: You can include markdown in this and have it rendered
# when the web site is generated

description="""
You can either pipe text to this script OR call it with the path
to a file. It will read in the text, find any urls starting with
http or https and wrap them with a tags that link to the url.

Example:

```
‚ùØ echo "foo https://example.com bar" | urls2links
foo <a href='https://example.com'>https://example.com</a> bar
```
