# The name of the command or function you're documenting
# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.
name="edit"
# a short (one line) description of what it does
short_description="open a file with <path>:<line_num> syntax in vim, emacs, or vscode"

# an optional detailed description of what it does.
# definitely include this if you're going to generate a web site.
# Note: You can include markdown in this and have it rendered
# when the web site is generated
#
description="""
Vim and Emacs, and who knows what else, don't handle the
path/to/file.txt:<line_number> syntax that's output by so many things.

This lets you edit a file at the appropriate line
in vim, emacs, and vscode by just copying that output from your logs,
or whatever, and pasting it in after `edit`. Yes you could edit the
output and do it manually but that gets old (annoying) fast.

So, `edit path/to/foo:44` will open up the `foo` file at line 44.


Note: no, you don't need this for vscode. The `code` command works just fine
without it, but I added it for some handwavey sense of "completeness". :P
