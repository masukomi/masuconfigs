# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.

Run `ipaddy` when you need to know what your current IP Address is on
the local network.

It will output a list of internet IP address that your computer thinks
belong to it.


Example:

```
❯ ipaddy
127.0.0.1
192.168.1.248
192.168.1.210
192.0.2.42 --> 192.0.2.42
```

NOTE: this does not mean people outside the network can find you at
that IP address. In fact, it's almost guaranteed that they can't.
