# The name of the command or function you're documenting
# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.
