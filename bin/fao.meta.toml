# The name of the command or function you're documenting
# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.

description="""
When you know what a file is called, but not where it is, use `fao` to
Find And Open it. Opens with whatever you have configured in your
`$EDITOR` environment variable.

Under the covers it's using `find` so asterisk style wildcards are
supported.  To Find And Open, every Markdown file, for example, you could
run `fao '*.md'`
