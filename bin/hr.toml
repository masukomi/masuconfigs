short_description="outputs a horizontal rule the width of your terminal"
description="""
a silly little utility that draws a horizontal rule the full width
of your terminal.

Not very useful by itself, but nice to call from other scripts
when you need to divide some information visually.

By default it'll use Box Drawings Light Horizontal (\\u2500) for
a nice smooth line, but you can pass it any character you want and
it'll use that instead. Want a line of hearts? `hr ‚ù§Ô∏è`

Note: emojis end up a little weird because they're frequently more
than one character wide but your terminal expects monospaced
characters. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Whatever. Experiment. Have fun.

USAGE: hr [character]
       If you pass it a character it will use that character to create
       the horizontal rule.
