description="""
A command line tool for generating Time based One-Time Passwords
[totp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password)

Found and hacked while I was trying to diagnose problems with
a TOTP integration in a ruby app.

Useful in that you have a standalone tool separate from your other
code that can generate TOTP tokens which you can then confirm
against the TOTP tokens generated by your other code at the same(ish)
time.

Original source unknown. :(
