short_description="Outputs a list of people who've worked on a file sorted by commits"
description="""
Provides you a sorted list of contributors by how many changes they've
made to the specified file. This is useful when you need to ask
someone a question about a file, and you're not sure who's best
qualified to ask. In the example below, I'd know that "Eugen" is the
person I should speak to.

If you pass it the `-b` (for "browser") option it'll generate an HTML graph of the
same information and open it in your browser.

Example output (from a random Mastodon file):
