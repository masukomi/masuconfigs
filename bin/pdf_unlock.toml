# The name of the command or function you're documenting
# This is the thing you type to invoke it. Note: git scripts
# are typically named git-foo but you invoke them as 'git foo'.
# It's your call, but for these I'd recommend using git-foo in
# the name field. This will enable Clu to tell you where it's
# located on your system.
name="pdf_unlock"
# a short (one line) description of what it does
short_description="Removes the password protection from a PDF"

# an optional detailed description of what it does.
# definitely include this if you're going to generate a web site.
# Note: You can include markdown in this and have it rendered
# when the web site is generated

description="""
Give this a path to a PDF that's locked with password protection and it'll
generate a copy without the password protection.
