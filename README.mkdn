# What's this?

These are all my configuration files, and common scripts. Keeping them in git 
provides me with an easy way to keep all the computers I work on
functioning in the same manner.

## Installation Instructions (for me)
(setting up a new computer from scratch)

1. Install 1Password (~5 min)
2. Setup SSH Keys for Github 
3. Install osx-developer tools (~15 min)
4. Prep for [mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) (Mac App Store CLI)
    * Log in to Mac App Store
    * Install any one previously purchased app 
    * ðŸ‘† is an annoying workaround because apple disabled logging in via the command line
6. Place computer password onto clipboard because Homebrew is about to make you enter it 40 times. 
7. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
8. Install [yadm](https://yadm.io)
    * `brew install yadm`
    * `yadm init`
    * `yadm remote add origin git@github.com:masukomi/masuconfigs.git`
    * `yadm pull origin master`
    * `yadm bootstrap` 
      * This will take ~30 minutes. Don't run it with `time`. It'll just hang.
9. Run `task` and work through the todo items
10. Update todo items in `bootstrap` script to reflect current reality.
